##TODO List

####PHP/Backend
  * High priority: Create introductory SQL-tables for Routines and implement the corresponding api calls for accessing them
  * Low priority: Responses should also indicate the success/failure by using proper http status codes. For example when the url is incorrect causing no resource to be returned in the response, the status code should be set to 404.

####JS/Frontend
  * After successful registration redirect to login page and show registration message with user information.
  * Show login email of the user in the sidebar on home.html page.
